# The Amplification Project at UCLA

## Project Summary

The Amplification Project is an organization that spreads awareness of forced migration by acting as a digital archive for the artwork of those affected by it. My role in this movement is as a front-end developer, working on the redesign of the organization's website.

The most up-to-date version of The Amplification Project site is currently deployed at: https://theamplificationproject.netlify.app/.
